# smoke-metal-skin-cse457
Unity implementations of volumetric scattering, subsurface scattering, and metal reflections for Group K: Advanced Raytracing, UW CSE457 SP23

## High level description
We will extend the Project 3 Ray Tracer to support smoke and skin representation, along with another reflection model.

## Feature list
- Subsurface scattering (via BDSSRDF)
- Volumetric scattering
- Another reflection model
- Output: Showcase scene gallery

## Team assignments
- BSSRDF - Trevor
- Volumetric scattering - Braiden
- Metal reflections - Nik

## Development plan
Phase 1: Set up meshes and materials for scene targets (can see: silhouettes)
Phase 2: Implement core algorithms (can see: some features of object)
Phase 3: Finalize algorithms (can see: object details & sparkle)
