# smoke-metal-skin-cse457
This project extends the RayTracingInOneWeekend Book 1 path tracer with CPU multithreading, CUDA and OptiX support, and new geometry and materials such as cubes, emissives, and volumes. Created by Group K: Advanced Raytracing, UW CSE457 SP23

Requires Boost, libpng16, for CPU backend.

Requires stb_image, g++12 (nvcc 12.x is not currently compatible with g++13), CUDA 12.x, and OptiX 7.x for the two GPU backends.
