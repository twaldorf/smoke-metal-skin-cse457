Iif a given point (x,y,z) is on the sphere, then x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2.
If the given point (x,y,z) is inside the sphere, then x^2+y^2+z^2<R^2,
and if a given point (x,y,z) is outside the sphere, then x^2+y^2+z^2>R^2.

It gets uglier if the sphere center is at (Cx,Cy,Cz):
(x−Cx)^2+(y−Cy)^2+(z−Cz)^2=r^2

((A+tb)−C)⋅((A+tb)−C)=r^2
which becomes
t^2b⋅b+2tb⋅(A−C)+(A−C)⋅(A−C)−r^2=0
t is only unknown
0 roots of t -> miss
1 root of t -> hits but doesn't 'enter'
2 roots of t -> enter and exit
